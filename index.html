			<h2>Programming is Art</h2>
			<br>
			<p>So often, computer programs are seen as nothing more than utilities and confusing text. However, computer programming is a modern art, requiring great dedication, time, and attention to the finest details. Like many forms of art, it is quite often that all that is seen if the end product, and not the countless hours of learning, practising, creating, shaping, polishing, and testing which goes into creating the programs which run a vast portion of our modern world.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>We embarked upon this journey with nothing more than our laptops and an idea. Our idea was to be able to create art from programs by reading the language directly and allowing it to form works of art through our designs. Like a sculptor choosing a stone from which to create a monument to their skills, we had to carefully select a medium in which to create our project. After long thought and much deliberation, we decided upon a web based medium as we both have experience with it, when done right it is quite elegant, and is robust enough to allow us to be daring with our creation.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>This particular piece of artistic programming creates artwork by reading programs written in various languages (Java, C++), and then placing elements throughout the canvas, allowing you, the user, to have control over the colors of each element used in the creation of the program which was fed in in the form of a .txt file.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>To ensure that no two pieces of art generated by this program are identical, we ensured that no values pertaining to the design of the interior elements were hard coded, instead, we built the program to use algorithms in order to determine the size, shape, and placement, based upon the program that is read. Numerous aspects of the program that is read in are used to determine the final result, including the expressions, the number of characters in each expression, the number of semi colons in the expressions, and how many expressions are nested within each expression. By building our program in this way, we did our best to ensure each unique program will have a unique result, even if the programs have the same end goal.</p>

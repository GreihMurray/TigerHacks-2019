# TigerHacks-2019
A project my team worked on at TigerHacks 2019, which reads Java or C++ source code after being moved to a .txt file and creates attempts to create art based on different attributes of the code

# Over view
This project is written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. As the theme of TigerHacks 2019 was "The Arts" we decided to create a program that could create art from programs in order to provide a new way to see the same information. Parsing of data, creation of artwork, color selectors, file input, and project description were handled by me, while the hidden page and the gradient background were done by my teammate. This project has room for improvement, however, we are satisified with what we were able to complete in the limited time we had.
